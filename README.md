# Caesar-Cipher java app
#####By Brian Muigai

## DESCRITPTION
In "cryptography", a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, which this Java App utilises.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

A good example would be one like this, it shifts letters by reverse shift of 3 letters

Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD Deciphering is done with a right shift of 3 letters.
